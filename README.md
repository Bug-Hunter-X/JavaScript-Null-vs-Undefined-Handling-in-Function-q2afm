This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to handling null and undefined values. The 'bug.js' file contains a function with a potential issue, while 'bugSolution.js' shows how to address it.

The core problem is the lack of explicit checks for undefined values, which can lead to unexpected results or runtime errors if the function receives undefined instead of null inputs. The solution provides a comprehensive check, ensuring the function handles both null and undefined values gracefully.
